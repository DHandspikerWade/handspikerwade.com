            Yes, you are looking at a relatively blank page. I am it fact a web developer; mostly 
            backend development with PHP. Which means you should be looking at a fancy page with all 
            the bells and whistles, right? Well yes but have you ever seen a mechanic finish working on 
            their own car?
        </p>
        <p>
            Basically the same concept. Start projects for myself and then never get around to finishing it. 
            Trying to build a site for yourself tends to end up like trying to swim the ocean. You end up starting with 
            a grand plan and then spend a ludicrous amount of time thinking of all the &apos;what ifs&apos; for when you get 
            to the other side. Once you actually put your toes in the water, the project has lost its luster. 
        </p>

        <p>
            If you would like you see any of these half started projects, check out my Bitbucket account at 
            <a href="https://bitbucket.org/handspiker2">https://bitbucket.org/handspiker2</a>. You&apos;ll see a bit 
            of everything. Some PHP, ASP.NET, Java, Node.js, Lua, Python, and whatever language or technology 
            I thought was interesting at the time. Even the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/handspiker2/portfolio-front-end">shoddy portfolio</a> that was thrown together because 
            it was a requirement of a college course. 
        </p>
        <p>
            That being said I do actually have some profession projects under my belt. I have worked at 
            agencies in past such as Kula Partners, Cossette Media, and am currently working at Verb Interactive as 
             a backend developer. The projects include mixtures of WordPress, Drupal, HubSpot, Symfony, and surprising amounts vehicle/tire APIs.
            If you would actually like to know more about the projects, give me a shout. 
        </p>

            If you would like to get in contact with me, the best ways are usually Twitter, email, or Linkedin.

        Footnotes:
        <ol>
            <li>This page probably has a lot of grammar issues and was mostly written as a joke.</li>
            <li>Yes, Handspiker-Wade is my actual name. It&apos;s not made up.</li>
            <li>Tabs are the proper way to indent code. They&apos;re a character specifically meant for indentation.</li>
            <li>Opinions are based on my personal beliefs. They are not representative of any current or past employer.</li>
            <li>This is a static page; there isn&apos;t a login page. Stop filling the my logs with garbage. </li>            
            <li>Please don&apos;t email me offering your services to build a website. Seriously.</li>
